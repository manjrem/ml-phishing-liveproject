## What is this repo for?

Throughout the project, I'll need to submit work to the authors and mentors for review. That often times is provided via a link to a Jupyter notebook (at least so far). This repo will contain that information.

If you've happened to stumble upon this repo and after browsing the contents find it interesting -- I'd follow the link above, purchase the liveProject, and give it a shot yourself!
